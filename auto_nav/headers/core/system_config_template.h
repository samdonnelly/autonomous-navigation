 * @brief System configuration template 
 * 
 * @details This file is a template and is not to be altered unless there is a system 
 *          configuration setting being added or removed. This means these settings should 
 *          not be used to configure your system. Instead, create a "system_config.h" file 
 *          in the same folder as this file and redefine each of the macros below (i.e. 
 *          copy the contents of this file) and change those to configure your system. 
 *          "system_config.h" is not tracked so it's specific to your use case, but it's 
 *          included in the build path. This file is tracked but excluded from the build 
 *          path.
